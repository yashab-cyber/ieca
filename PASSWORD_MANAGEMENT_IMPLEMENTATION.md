# Password Management System Implementation

## Overview

This implementation adds a complete password management system to the IECA application, solving the critical issue where approved members couldn't login because they had no passwords.

## üöÄ Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic User Account Creation**
- When an application is approved, a user account is automatically created
- Secure password is generated automatically
- Profile is populated with application data
- Login credentials are emailed to the new member

### 2. **Password Generation & Security**
- Cryptographically secure password generation
- 12-character passwords with complexity requirements:
  - At least one lowercase letter
  - At least one uppercase letter  
  - At least one number
  - At least one special character (@#$%&*!)
- bcrypt hashing with 12 salt rounds
- Passwords are never stored in plain text

### 3. **Password Reset System**
- Forgot password functionality on login page
- Secure reset tokens with 1-hour expiration
- Email-based password reset links
- Password strength validation
- Confirmation emails after successful reset

### 4. **Password Change in Profile**
- Users can change passwords in their profile settings
- Current password verification required
- New password strength validation
- Confirmation emails after successful change

### 5. **Email Templates**
- **Login Credentials Email**: Welcome email with temporary password for new members
- **Password Reset Email**: Secure reset link with instructions
- **Password Change Confirmation**: Security notification after password changes
- All emails use consistent IECA branding and styling

### After (Solution)  
1. Admin approves application ‚úÖ
2. System generates secure password ‚úÖ
3. System creates User account with hashed password ‚úÖ
4. System creates UserProfile with application data ‚úÖ
5. System sends login credentials email ‚úÖ
6. User receives email with username/password ‚úÖ
7. User can successfully login ‚úÖ
8. User can change password in profile settings ‚úÖ

## üîê Security Features

### Password Generation
```typescript
// Generates secure 12-character password
const password = PasswordService.generatePassword();
// Example: "Kx7@mP9nL2#q"
```

### Password Hashing
```typescript
// bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
const hashedPassword = await PasswordService.hashPassword(password);
// Example: "$2a$12$..."
```

### Password Reset Security
- Cryptographically secure reset tokens
- 1-hour token expiration
- Tokens are single-use only
- Secure random token generation

## üìß Email Templates

### 1. Login Credentials Email
- **Subject**: "Welcome to IECA - Your Login Credentials"
- **Content**: Welcome message, login credentials, quick start guide
- **Features**: Portal overview, security instructions, direct login link

### 2. Password Reset Email  
- **Subject**: "IECA - Password Reset Request"
- **Content**: Reset instructions, secure reset link, security warnings
- **Features**: 1-hour expiration notice, security tips

### 3. Password Change Confirmation
- **Subject**: "IECA - Password Changed Successfully" 
- **Content**: Change confirmation, security tips, suspicious activity warning
- **Features**: Timestamp, security recommendations

## üõ† Database Schema Updates

### User Model
```prisma
model User {
  // ... existing fields
  resetToken       String?   // Password reset token
  resetTokenExpiry DateTime? // Token expiration time
  // ... rest of model
}
```

### UserProfile Model  
```prisma
model UserProfile {
  // ... existing fields
  motivation String? // Added from application
  phone      String? // Added from application
